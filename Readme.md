To create an AI agent capable of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based analysis of a textbook that is already uploaded to the repository, we need to follow these steps:

Install necessary libraries: Ensure the required libraries are installed.
Load the textbook document: Read the textbook from the repository.
Preprocess the document: Prepare the document for analysis.
Create a RAG model: Use a pre-trained RAG model for document analysis.
Analyze the document: Perform analysis using the RAG model.
Output the results: Display or save the analyzed results.
Below is the full code to achieve this:

Python
# Step 1: Install necessary libraries
# You can install the required libraries using pip
# !pip install transformers datasets faiss-cpu

# Step 2: Load the textbook document
# Assuming the textbook is in a text file in the repository
import os

# Replace these variables with the actual path and filename in the repository
repository_path = 'path/to/repository'
textbook_filename = 'textbook.txt'

# Construct the full path to the textbook file
textbook_path = os.path.join(repository_path, textbook_filename)
with open(textbook_path, 'r') as file:
    textbook_content = file.read()

# Step 3: Preprocess the document
# Here we might split the document into chunks if needed for analysis
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-token-base")
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(textbook_content)
chunks = [tokens[i:i + 512] for i in range(0, len(tokens), 512)]

# Step 4: Create a RAG model
from transformers import RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, RagSequenceForGeneration

# Load the RAG model and retriever
rag_tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-base")
rag_retriever = RagRetriever.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-base", index_name="exact", use_dummy_dataset=True)
rag_model = RagSequenceForGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-base", retriever=rag_retriever)

# Step 5: Analyze the document
# Define the questions for analysis
questions = [
    "What is the main topic of the textbook?",
    "Who is the author of the textbook?",
    "What are the key points mentioned in the textbook?"
]

# Perform analysis on the document
answers = []
for question in questions:
    inputs = rag_tokenizer(question, return_tensors="pt")
    generated = rag_model.generate(input_ids=inputs["input_ids"], num_return_sequences=1)
    answer = rag_tokenizer.batch_decode(generated, skip_special_tokens=True)
    answers.append(answer[0])

# Step 6: Output the results
# Print the answers to the questions
for question, answer in zip(questions, answers):
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    print(f"Answer: {answer}\n")
Explanation:
Install Necessary Libraries: Ensure the transformers, datasets, and faiss-cpu libraries are installed.
Load the Textbook Document: Load the textbook content from a file in the repository.
Preprocess the Document: Tokenize and split the document into chunks if necessary.
Create a RAG Model: Load the pre-trained RAG model and retriever from Hugging Face.
Analyze the Document: Use the RAG model to generate answers to predefined questions.
Output the Results: Print the answers to the questions.
Steps to Run the Code:
Save the code in a Python file (e.g., rag_analysis.py).
Replace 'path/to/repository' and 'textbook.txt' with the actual path and filename in your repository.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pip install transformers datasets faiss-cpu).
Run the Python file (python rag_analysis.py).
This example provides a framework for RAG-based document analysis. You can customize the questions and model based on your specific needs. Let me know if you need further customization or additional features!
